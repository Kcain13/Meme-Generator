# Meme-Generator
What is it?
  - Create your own Meme Application
  - Building a meme generator in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Why am I making it?
  - To no longer waste time scowering the internet for a meme that may or maynot exist
  - My friend group has their own inside jokes and the ability to implement them into a meme creates greater personalization in humor.

Who is it for?
  - Those that interact with their friends and co-workers through humor

How?
- The generator should consist of a form that accepts a link to an image, text for the top of the meme, and text for the bottom of the meme. When the user submits the form, use JavaScript to append to the DOM a div which contains the meme, including the image and its text.
